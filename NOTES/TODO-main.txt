  * render a text buffer
  * work with multiple selections in text buffer
  * keybindings (including a human-redable serialization format)
  * fuzzy complete from database (with cache of previous selections)
  * infinite history
  * apply multiple layers of formatting to text
  * plugin language and engine
  * regex engine
  * hex editor
  * load/save a file in chunks rather than whole
  * look at git repo to see which files have conflicts
    when they do, render the two versions side-by-side inline


  * advanced techniques: a selections stack (would require re-engineering the EditBuffer zippers and Slices module, b/c Marks could appear anywhere)
