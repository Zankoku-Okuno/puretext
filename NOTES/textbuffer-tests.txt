uncons Nil === Nothing
uncons (cons x xs) === Just (x, xs)
unsnoc Nil === Nothing

when str non-empty and not a substring in xs:
    splitAtChar i xs === both (fromText str) $ T.splitAt i (toText str xs)
uncurry (<>) (splitAtChar i xs) === xs
uncurry (<>) (splitEndChar i xs) === xs


both f (x, y) = (f x, f y)
