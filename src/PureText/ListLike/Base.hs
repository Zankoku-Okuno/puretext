The classic defining axioms of lists are 'nil', 'cons', and 'uncons',
    which are all constant-time.

Some types have sub-linear 'append' (e.g. finger trees),
    so we've included 'append' as an additional introduction form.
Filling out the primitive operations centered around @append@ are
    'nil', 'singleton', and 'uncons'.

Some other functions, with constant-time default implementations are also given here.
For additional list-like algorithms,
    see 'ListFold' (general linear-time fold-based algorithms),
    and 'ListLike' (additional algorithms commonly expected on lists).
Also see 'SeqCore' and the coresponding 'SeqFold', 'SeqLike'
    for list-like operations that work on the back of the list.

Its 'SeqCore' implementation lifts 'cons' and 'uncons' into 'snoc' and 'unsnoc'

Folds are the ur-operation for lists.
Maps and filters are defineable by fold,
    and from those come all the other algorithms you can expect.

Aside from just folds, this class also defines fold-based algorithms
    that consume all the data.
This is as opposed to algorithms that, though they could be fold based,
    consume data from the front (see 'ListLike'),
    consume data from the back (see 'SeqLike'), or
    consume data from the middle (see 'ArrayLike').
